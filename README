- Support for multiple accounts
- Header based mail filtering: filter junk mail before downloading it
- Delivery to mbox files, maildir folders, or a mail delivery agent (MDA)

mpop runs on a wide variety of platforms. It needs little more than an ANSI C
compiler and Berkeley-style sockets. It does not require any additional libraries,
but it can use the following to enhance its feature set:
- GnuTLS. The GnuTLS library provides TLS support.
  Alternatively, libtls from the LibreSSL project can be used.
- GNU SASL. Using the GNU SASL library adds support for some additional
  authentication methods, including SCRAM-* and GSSAPI.
- GNU libidn2. On modern Linux systems with recent glibc and GnuTLS
  libraries, mpop has automatic support for Internationalized Domain Names
  (IDN). On other systems, IDN support is available via libidn2.
