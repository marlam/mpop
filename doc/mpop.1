.SH NAME
mpop \- A POP3 client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP "Mail retrieval mode (default):"
.B mpop
[option...] [\-\-] [account...]
.br
.B mpop
\-\-host=host [option...]
.IP "Server information mode:"
.B mpop
[option...] \-\-serverinfo [account...]
.br
.B mpop
\-\-host=host [option...] \-\-serverinfo
.SH DESCRIPTION
In mail retrieval mode of operation, mpop retrieves mails from one or more POP3
mailboxes, optionally does some filtering, and delivers them through a mail
delivery agent (MDA), to a maildir folder, or to an mbox file.
Mails that were successfully delivered before will not be retrieved a second
time, even if errors occur or mpop is terminated in the middle of a session.
.br
In server information mode, mpop prints information about one or more POP3
servers.
.br
If no account names are given on the command line, one named \fIdefault\fP
will be used.
.br
The best way to start is probably to have a look at the EXAMPLES section.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The standard sendmail exit codes are used, as defined in sysexits.h.
.SH OPTIONS
Options override configuration file settings, for every used account.
.IP "\fBGeneral Options\fP"
.RS
.IP "\-\-version"
Print version information, including information about the libraries used.
.IP "\-\-help"
Print help.
.IP "\-P, \-\-pretend"
Print the configuration settings that would be used, but do not take further
action.  An asterisk (`*') will be printed instead of your password.
.IP "\-d, \-\-debug"
Print lots of debugging information, including the whole conversation with the
server. Be careful with this option: the (potentially dangerous) output
will not be sanitized, and your password may get printed in an easily decodable
format!
.br
This option implies \-\-half\-quiet, because the progress output would interfere
with the debugging output.
.RE
.IP "\fBChanging the mode of operation\fP"
.RS
.IP "\-S, \-\-serverinfo"
Print information about the POP3 server(s) and exit. This includes information
about supported features (pipelining, authentication methods, TOP command, ...),

.RE
.SH USAGE
The default configuration file is ~/.mpoprc or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpop/config.
Settings in this file can be changed by command line options.
.br
A configuration file is a simple text file. Empty lines and comment lines
(first non-blank character is '#') are ignored. Every other line must
contain a command and may contain an argument to that command.
The argument may be enclosed in double quotes (").
.br
If a file name starts with the tilde (~), this tilde will be replaced by
$HOME.
.br
If a command accepts the argument \fIon\fP, it also accepts an empty argument
and treats that as if it was \fIon\fP.
.br
Commands are organized in accounts. Each account starts with the \fIaccount\fP
command and defines the settings for one POP3 account.
.PP
Commands are as follows:
.IP "defaults"
Set defaults. The following configuration commands will set default values for
all following account definitions.
.IP "account \fIname\fP [:\fIaccount\fP[,...]]"
Start a new account definition with the given name. The current default values
are filled in.
.br
If a colon and a list of previously defined accounts is given after the account
name, the new account, with the filled in default values, will inherit all
settings from the accounts in the list.
.IP "host \fIhostname\fP"
The POP3 server to retrieve mails from.
The argument may be a host name or a network address.
Every account definition must contain this command.
.IP "port \fInumber\fP"
The port that the POP3 server listens on. The default is 110 ("pop3"), unless
TLS without STARTTLS is used, in which case it is 995 ("pop3s").
.IP "source_ip [\fIIP\fP]"
Set a source IP address to bind the outgoing connection to. Useful only in
special cases on multi-home systems. An empty argument disables this.
.IP "proxy_host [\fIIP|hostname\fP]"
Use a SOCKS proxy. All network traffic will go through this proxy host,
including DNS queries, except for a DNS query that might be necessary to
resolve the proxy host name itself (this can be avoided by using an IP address
as proxy host name). An empty \fIhostname\fP argument disables proxy usage.
The supported SOCKS protocol version is 5. If you want to use this with Tor,
see also "Using mpop with Tor" below.
.IP "proxy_port [\fInumber\fP]"
Set the port number for the proxy host. An empty \fInumber\fP argument resets
this to the default port, which is 1080 ("socks").
.IP "timeout (\fIoff\fP|\fIseconds\fP)"
Set or unset a network timeout, in seconds. The default is 180 seconds. The
argument \fIoff\fP means that no timeout will be set, which means that the
operating system default will be used.
.IP "pipelining (\fIauto\fP|\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)"
Enable or disable POP3 pipelining. You should never need to change the default
setting, which is \fIauto\fP: mpop enables pipelining for POP3 servers that
advertise this capability, and disables it for all other servers.  Pipelining
can speed up a POP3 session substantially.
.IP "auth [(\fIon\fP|\fImethod\fP)]"
Choose an authentication method. The default argument \fIon\fP chooses a
method automatically.
.br
Usually a user name and a password are used for authentication. The user name
is specified in the configuration file with the \fBuser\fP command. There are five
different methods to specify the password:
.br
1. Add the password to the system key ring.
Currently supported key rings are the Gnome key ring and the Mac OS X Keychain.
For the Gnome key ring, use the command secret\-tool (part of Gnome's
libsecret) to store passwords: secret\-tool store \-\-label=mpop host
pop.freemail.example service pop3 user joe.smith.
On Mac OS X, use the following command: security add\-internet\-password
\-s pop.freemail.example \-r pop3 \-a joe.smith \-w.
In both examples, replace pop.freemail.example with the POP3 server name, and
joe.smith with your user name.
.br
2. Store the password in an encrypted files, and use \fBpasswordeval\fP
to specify a command to decrypt that file, e.g. using GnuPG. See EXAMPLES.
.br
3. Store the password in the configuration file using the \fBpassword\fP command.
(Usually it is not considered a good idea to store passwords in plain text files.
If you do it anyway, you must make sure that the file can only be read by yourself.)
.br
4. Store the password in ~/.netrc. This method is probably obsolete.
.br
5. Type the password into the terminal when it is required.
.br
It is recommended to use method 1 or 2.
.br
Multiple authentication methods exist. Most servers support only some of them.
Historically, sophisticated methods were developed to protect passwords from
being sent unencrypted to the server, but nowadays everybody needs TLS anyway,
so the simple methods suffice since the whole session is protected. A suitable
authentication method is chosen automatically, and when TLS is disabled for
some reason, only methods that avoid sending clear text passwords are
considered.
.br
The following user / password methods are supported: \fIuser\fP (a simple plain
text method supported by all servers), \fIplain\fP (another simple plain text
method, supported by almost all servers),
\fIscram\-sha\-1\fP (a method that avoids clear-text passwords),
\fIapop\fP (an obsolete method that avoids clear-text passwords, but is not
considered secure anymore),
\fIcram\-md5\fP (an obsolete method that avoids clear-text passwords, but is not
considered secure anymore),
\fIdigest\-md5\fP (an overcomplicated
obsolete method that avoids clear-text passwords, but is not considered secure
anymore), \fIlogin\fP (a non-standard clear-text method similar to but worse
than the plain method), \fIntlm\fP (an obscure non-standard method that is now
considered broken; it sometimes requires a special domain parameter passed via
\fBntlmdomain\fP).
.br
There are currently two authentication methods that are not based on user /
password information and have to be chosen manually: \fIexternal\fP (the
authentication happens outside of the protocol, typically by sending a TLS
client certificate, and the method merely confirms that this authentication
succeeded), and \fIgssapi\fP (the Kerberos framework takes care of secure
authentication, only a user name is required).
.br
It depends on the underlying authentication library and its version whether a
particular method is supported or not. Use \fB\-\-version\fP to find out which
methods are supported.
.IP "user \fIlogin\fP"
Set the user name for authentication. An empty argument unsets the user name.
.IP "password \fIsecret\fP"
Set the password for authentication. An empty argument unsets the password.
Consider using the \fBpasswordeval\fP command or a key ring instead of this
command, to avoid storing plain text passwords in the configuration file.
.IP "passwordeval [\fIeval\fP]"
Set the password for authentication to the output (stdout) of the command
\fIeval\fP.
This can be used e.g. to decrypt password files on the fly or to query key
rings, and thus to avoid storing plain text passwords.
.IP "ntlmdomain [\fIdomain\fP]"
Set a domain for the \fBntlm\fP authentication method. This is obsolete.
.IP "tls [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Enable or disable TLS (also known as SSL) for secured connections.
You also need \fBtls_trust_file\fP or \fBtls_fingerprint\fP, and for some
servers you may need to disable \fBtls_starttls\fP.
.br
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
"... provides communications privacy over the Internet.  The protocol
allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to
prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery" (quote from RFC2246).
.br
A server can use TLS in one of two modes: via a STARTTLS command (the session
starts with the normal protocol initialization, and TLS is then
started using the protocol's STARTTLS command), or immediately (TLS is
initialized before the normal protocol initialization; this requires a
separate port). The first mode is the default, but you can switch to the
second mode by disabling \fBtls_starttls\fP.
.br
When TLS is started, the server sends a certificate to identify itself. To
verify the server identity, a client program is expected to check that the
certificate is formally correct and that it was issued by a Certificate
Authority (CA) that the user trusts. (There can also be certificate chains with
intermediate CAs.)
.br
The list of trusted CAs is specified using the \fBtls_trust_file\fP command.
Usually there is some system-wide default file available, e.g.
/etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt on Debian-based systems, but you can
also choose to select the trusted CAs yourself.
.br
One practical problem with this approach is that the client program should also
check if the server certificate has been revoked for some reason, using a
Certificate Revocation List (CRL). A CRL file can be specified using the
\fBtls_crl_file\fP command, but getting the relevant CRL files and keeping them
up to date is not straightforward. You are basically on your own.
.br
A much more serious and fundamental problem is is that you need to trust CAs.
Like any other organization, a CA can be incompetent, malicious, subverted by
bad people, or forced by government agencies to compromise end users without
telling them. All of these things happened and continue to happen worldwide.
The idea to have central organizations that have to be trusted for your
communication to be secure is fundamentally broken.
.br
Instead of putting trust in a CA, you can choose to trust only a single
certificate for the server you want to connect to. For that purpose, specify
the certificate fingerprint with \fBtls_fingerprint\fP. This makes sure that no
man-in-the-middle can fake the identity of the server by presenting you a
fraudulent certificate issued by some CA that happens to be in your trust list.
However, you have to update the fingerprint whenever the server certificate
changes, and you have to make sure that the change is legitimate each time,
e.g. when the old certificate expired. This is inconvenient, but it's the price
to pay.
.br
Information about a server certificate can be obtained with \fI\-\-serverinfo
\-\-tls \-\-tls\-certcheck=off\fP. This includes the issuer CA of the certificate (so
you can trust that CA via \fBtls_trust_file\fP), and the fingerprint of the
certificate (so you can trust that particular certificate via
\fBtls_fingerprint\fP).
.br
TLS also allows the server to verify the identity of the client. For this
purpose, the client has to present a certificate issued by a CA that the server
trusts. To present that certificate, the client also needs the matching key
file. You can set the certificate and key files using \fBtls_cert_file\fP and
\fBtls_key_file\fP. This mechanism can also be used to authenticate users, so
that traditional user / password authentication is not necessary anymore. See the
\fIexternal\fP mechanism in \fBauth\fP.
.IP "tls_starttls [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Choose the TLS variant: start TLS from within the session (\fIon\fP, default),
or tunnel the session through TLS (\fIoff\fP).
.IP "tls_trust_file \fIfile\fP"
Activate server certificate verification using a list of trusted Certification
Authorities (CAs). The file must be in PEM format. Some systems provide a
system-wide default file, e.g. /etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates.crt on
Debian-based systems with the ca\-certificates package.
An empty argument disables this. You should also use \fBtls_crl_file\fP.
.IP "tls_crl_file [\fIfile\fP]"
Set a certificate revocation list (CRL) file for TLS, to check for revoked
certificates. An empty argument disables this.
.IP "tls_fingerprint [\fIfingerprint\fP]"
Set the fingerprint of a single certificate to accept for TLS. This certificate
will be trusted regardless of its contents. The fingerprint should be of type SHA256,
but can for backwards compatibility also be of type SHA1 or MD5 (please avoid this).
The format should be 01:23:45:67:....
Use \fI\-\-serverinfo \-\-tls \-\-tls\-certcheck=off \-\-tls\-fingerprint=\fP
to get the server certificate fingerprint.
.IP "tls_key_file \fIfile\fP"
Send a client certificate to the server (use this together with
\fBtls_cert_file}\fP).
The file must contain the private key of a certificate in PEM format. An empty
argument disables this feature.
.IP "tls_cert_file \fIfile\fP"
Send a client certificate to the server (use this together with
\fBtls_key_file\fP).
The file must contain a certificate in PEM format. An empty argument disables
this feature.
.IP "tls_certcheck [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Enable or disable checks of the server certificate.
WARNING: When the checks are disabled, TLS sessions will be vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks!
.IP "tls_min_dh_prime_bits [\fIbits\fP]"
Set or unset the minimum number of Diffie-Hellman (DH) prime bits that mpop
will accept for TLS sessions.  The default is set by the TLS library and can be
selected by using an empty argument to this command.  Only lower the default
(for example to 512 bits) if there is no other way to make TLS work with the
remote server.
.IP "tls_priorities [\fIpriorities\fP]"
Set the priorities for TLS sessions. The default is set by the TLS library and
can be selected by using an empty argument to this command.
See the GnuTLS documentation of the \fIgnutls_priority_init\fP function for a
description of the priorities string.
.IP "delivery \fImethod\fP \fImethod_arguments...\fP
How to deliver messages received from this account.
.RS
.IP "delivery mda \fIcommand\fP"
Deliver the mails through a mail delivery agent (MDA).
.br
All occurrences of %F in the command will be replaced with the envelope from
address of the current message (or MAILER\-DAEMON if none is found). Note that
this address is guaranteed to contain only letters a-z and A-Z, digits 0-9, and
any of ".@_\-+/", even though that is only a subset of what is theoretically
allowed in a mail address. Other characters, including those interpreted by the
shell, are replaced with "_".  Nevertheless, you should put %F into single
quotes: \(aq%F\(aq.
.br
Use "delivery mda /usr/bin/procmail \-f \(aq%F\(aq \-d $USER" for the procmail
MDA.
.br
Use "delivery mda /usr/sbin/sendmail \-oi \-oem \-f \(aq%F\(aq \-\- $USER" to
let your MTA handle the mail.
.br
Use "delivery mda /usr/local/bin/msmtp \-\-host=localhost \-\-from=\(aq%F\(aq
\-\- $USER@`hostname`.`dnsdomainname`" to pass the mail to your MTA via SMTP.
(This is what fetchmail does by default.)
.IP "delivery maildir \fIdirectory\fP"
Deliver the mails to the given maildir directory. The directory must exist and
it must have the maildir subdirectories \fIcur\fP, \fInew\fP, and \fItmp\fP;
mpop will not create directories. This delivery type only works on file systems
that support hard links.
.IP "delivery mbox \fImbox-file\fP"
Deliver the mails to the given file in mbox format. The file will be locked
with \fBfcntl(2)\fP. mpop uses the MBOXRD mbox format variant; see the
documentation of the mbox format.
.IP "delivery exchange \fIdirectory\fP"
Deliver the mails to the given Exchange pickup directory. The directory must
exist.
.PP
If the delivery method needs to parse the mail headers for an envelope from
address (the mda method if the command contains %F, and the mbox method), then
it needs to create a temporary file to store the mail headers (but not the body)
in. See $TMPDIR in the FILES / ENVIRONMENT section.
.RE
.IP "uidls_file \fIfilename\fP"
The file to store UIDLs in. These are needed to identify new messages.
%U in the filename will be replaced by the username of the current account.
%H in the filename will be replaced by the hostname of the current account.
If the filename contains directories that do not exist, mpop will create them.
mpop locks this file for exclusive access when accessing the associated POP3
account.
.br
The default value is "~/.mpop_uidls/%U_at_%H". You can also use a single UIDLS
file for multiple accounts, but then you cannot poll more than one of these
accounts at the same time.
.IP "only_new [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
By default, mpop processes only new messages (new messages are those that were
not already successfully retrieved in an earlier session). If this option is
turned off, mpop will process all messages.
.IP "keep [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Keep all mails on the POP3 server, never delete them. The default behaviour is
to delete mails that have been successfully retrieved or filtered by kill
filters.
.IP "killsize (\fIoff\fP|\fIsize\fP)"
Mails larger than the given size will be deleted (unless the \fBkeep\fP command
is used, in which case they will just be skipped).
The size argument must be zero or greater. If it is followed by a `k' or
an `m', the size is measured in kibibytes/mebibytes instead of bytes.
Note that some POP3 servers report slightly incorrect sizes for mails; see
\fBNOTES\fP below.
.br
When \fBkillsize\fP is set to 0 and \fBkeep\fP is set to on, then all mails are
marked as retrieved, but no mail gets deleted from the server. This can be used
to synchronize the UID list on the client to the UID list on the server.
.IP "skipsize (\fIoff\fP|\fIsize\fP)"
Mails larger than the given size will be skipped (not downloaded).
The size argument must be zero or greater. If it is followed by a `k' or
an `m', the size is measured in kibibytes/mebibytes instead of bytes.
Note that some POP3 servers report slightly incorrect sizes for mails; see
\fBNOTES\fP below.
.IP "filter [\fIcommand\fP]"
Set a filter which will decide whether to retrieve, skip, or delete each mail
by investigating the mail's headers. The POP3 server must support the POP3 TOP
command for this to work; see option \fB\-\-serverinfo\fP above. An empty argument
disables filtering.
.br
All occurrences of %F in the command will be replaced with the envelope from
address of the current message (or MAILER\-DAEMON if none is found).
Note that this address is guaranteed to contain only letters a-z and A-Z,
digits 0-9, and any of ".@_\-+/", even though that is only a subset of what is
theoretically allowed in a mail address. Other characters, including those
interpreted by the shell, are replaced with "_". Nevertheless, you should put
%F into single quotes: \(aq%F\(aq.
.br
All occurrences of %S in the command will be replaced with the size of the
current mail as reported by the POP3 server.
.br
The mail headers (plus the blank line separating the headers from the body)
will be piped to the command. Based on the return code, mpop decides
what to do with the mail:
.br
0: proceed normally; no special action
.br
1: delete the mail; do not retrieve it
.br
2: skip the mail; do not retrieve it
.br
Return codes greater than or equal to 3 mean that an error occurred. The
sysexits.h error codes may be used to give information about the kind of the
error, but this is not necessary.
.RE
.IP "received_header [(\fIon\fP|\fIoff\fP)]"
Enable or disable adding a Received header. By default, mpop prepends a
Received header to the mail during delivery. This is required by the RFCs if
the mail is subsequently further delivered e.g. via SMTP.
.SH FILTERING
There are three filtering commands available.  They will be executed in the
following order:
.br
.B killsize
.br
.B skipsize
.br
.B filter
.br
If a filtering command applies to a mail, the remaining filters will not be
executed.

# Authentication. The password is given using one of five methods, see below.
.br
user joe.smith
.br

.br
# Password method 1: Add the password to the system keyring, and let mpop get
.br
# it automatically. To set the keyring password using Gnome's libsecret:
.br
# $ secret\-tool store \-\-label=mpop \\
.br
#   host pop.freemail.example \\
.br
#   service pop3 \\
.br
#   user joe.smith
.br

.br
# Password method 2: Store the password in an encrypted file, and tell mpop
.br
# which command to use to decrypt it. This is usually used with GnuPG, as in
.br
# this example. Usually gpg\-agent will ask once for the decryption password.
.br
passwordeval gpg2 \-\-no\-tty \-q \-d ~/.mpop\-password.gpg
.br

.br
# Password method 3: Store the password directly in this file. Usually it is not
.br
# a good idea to store passwords in plain text files. If you do it anyway, at
.br
# least make sure that this file can only be read by yourself.
.br
#password secret123
.br

.br
# Password method 4: Store the password in ~/.netrc. This method is probably not
.br
# relevant anymore.
.br

.br
# Password method 5: Do not specify a password. Mpop will then prompt you for
.br
# it. This means you need to be able to type into a terminal when mpop runs.

.PP
.B Filtering with SpamAssassin
.PP
The command
.B filter\ "/path/to/spamc \-c > /dev/null"
will delete all mails that SpamAssassin thinks are spam. Since no message body
is passed to SpamAssassin, you should disable all body-specific tests in the
SpamAssassin configuration file; for example set
.B use_bayes 0.
.PP
If your mail provider runs SpamAssassin for you, you just have to check for the
result. The following script can do that when used as an mpop filter:
.br
#!/bin/sh
.br
if [ "`grep "^X\-Spam\-Status: Yes"`" ]; then
.br
    exit 1  # kill this message
.br
else
.br
    exit 0  # proceed normally
.br
fi
.br
Since the filter command is passed to a shell, you can also use this directly:
.br
.B filter if [\ "`grep\ "^X\-Spam\-Status: Yes"`" ]; then exit 1; else exit 0; fi

.br
.PP
.B Using mpop with Tor
.PP
Use the following settings:
.br
.B proxy_host 127.0.0.1
.br
.B proxy_port 9050
.br
.B tls on
.br
Use an IP address as proxy host name, so that mpop does not leak a DNS query
when resolving it.
.br
TLS is required to prevent exit hosts from reading your POP3 session. You also
need \fBtls_trust_file\fP or \fBtls_fingerprint\fP to check the server
identity.


.SH FILES
.IP "~/.mpoprc or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpop/config"
Default configuration file.
.IP "~/.mpop_uidls"
Default directory to store UIDLs files in.
.IP "~/.netrc and SYSCONFDIR/netrc"
The netrc file contains login information. Before prompting for a password,
msmtp will search it in ~/.netrc and SYSCONFDIR/netrc.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP "$USER, $LOGNAME"
These variables override the user's login name. $LOGNAME is only used if $USER
is unset. The user's login name is used for Received headers.
.IP "$TMPDIR"
Directory to create temporary files in. If this is unset, a system specific
default directory is used.
